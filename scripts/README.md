# Scripts

This directory includes scripts and tools to reproduce our analysis.

Note that certain settings that affect how we get and process data are included in the [config.py](../config.py) file. That includes settings like the list of bilateral donors, the list of developing countries recipients (for non CRS data), and whether to exclude China and In-donor Refugee Costs.


## ODA Data
Scripts to process and analysis ODA data from the OECD DAC are included in the [dac_data](./dac_data) folder.

For more information, see the [README](./dac_data/README.md) in that folder.
